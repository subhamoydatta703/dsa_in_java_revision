1. Method Scope

Definition:
Variables declared inside a method can be accessed only within that method.
They are created when the method is called and destroyed when it ends.

✅ Example:

public class MethodScopeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        greet();  // calling the method
        // System.out.println(message); ❌ Error: message not visible here
    }

    static void greet() {
        String message = "Hello from greet()!"; // variable declared inside method
        System.out.println(message); // ✅ Works fine
    }
}


🟩 Explanation:

The variable message is declared inside the method greet().

It’s accessible only inside greet().

Once the method ends, message is destroyed.

 2. Block Scope

Definition:
Variables declared inside any block { ... } — like if, for, or while — are accessible only inside that block.

✅ Example:

public class BlockScopeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;

        if (x > 5) {
            int y = 20; // variable inside if-block
            System.out.println("x + y = " + (x + y)); // ✅ Works fine
        }

        // System.out.println(y); ❌ Error: y is not visible outside the block
    }
}


🟩 Explanation:

Variable y is declared inside the if block.

It cannot be used outside the block {} where it’s declared.

The lifetime of y ends when the block ends.

⚖️ Difference Summary
Feature	Method Scope	Block Scope
Declared Inside	A method	A block (if, for, etc.)
Lifetime	Exists during method execution	Exists during block execution
Accessible From	Only inside that method	Only inside that block
Example	String msg = "Hi"; inside a method	int i = 0; inside a for loop
